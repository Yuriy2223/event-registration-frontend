Events Registration App
Overview
Web-based application for events registration. There are three complexity levels: base, middle, and advanced. The base level is sufficient to pass the test task stage. Still, accomplished tasks with a harder level of complexity will highly increase your chance of getting to the school.

What has been accomplished
Base Level
Events Board Page: Implemented a paginated list of available events with the following details:

Title
Description
Event Date
Organizer
Event Registration Page: Users can register for events by filling out a form with:

Full Name
Email
Date of Birth
"Where did you hear about this event?"
Once submitted, the registration data is stored in a database.

Event Participants Page: Users can view a list of registered participants by clicking the “View” button.

Middle Level
Events Board Page: Added the ability to sort events by:

Title
Event Date
Organizer
Event Registration Page:

Implemented form validation.
Added a DatePicker for the Date of Birth input.
Event Participants Page: Added the ability to search participants by Full Name and Email.

Project Structure
Created two projects: one for the frontend using React.js, and another for the backend using Node.js. The application is connected to a MongoDB database.
